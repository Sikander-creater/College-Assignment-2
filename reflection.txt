# My Reflection

What surprised me about working with files:
It was easy to read my shopping list file, and Python could automatically number and analyze each line.

How this connects to business:
Many tasks in business involve handling lists or logs. Knowing how to quickly process files can save time and make data more useful.

Next thing I want to learn:
I want to learn how to read CSV or Excel files and calculate things like totals or averages for shopping or budget tracking.
