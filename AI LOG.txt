# AI Collaboration Log

**My AI Prompt:**
"Make me a very short Python script to read `my_data.txt` (shopping list), print the lines with numbers, and show some basic stats (lines, words, etc.). Also create AI log and reflection in txt."

**What the AI Helped Me With:**
- Creating a small script that works with my shopping list file.
- Showing how to print each item with line numbers.
- Adding simple statistics like line count, word count, and longest line.
- Preparing AI log and reflection files in the right format.

**What I Learned:**
- How to open and read a text file safely with `with open()`.
- How to use `enumerate()` for numbering lines in the output.
- How to calculate basic statistics from text files with short Python code.
